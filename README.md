# Look Estate

## Overview

Look Estate is a side project inspired by my freelance work in data scraping and visualization. This project focuses on data aggregation, with background bots scraping multiple websites and storing the data in a centralized database.

This project is built with Vue.js for the frontend and Python for the backend server and data scraping bot.

## npm Commands

```bash
npm install  # install dependencies
npm run dev # Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run build # Compiles and minifies for production
npm run lint # Lints and fixes files
```

## Notes 2026-01-10

It's been a while since this project was last updated. I was careless not to maintain this portfolio. I believe this app is still valuable today.
